<h5>4. VIOLATIONS</h5>
<p><span style="color: #ce9707;">4.1 Flooding / Spamming (Minor Offense)</span><br />Flooding is when a player type messages repeatedly on screen to the point that it disrupts normal conversations between other players and the game as well. This can bother or harass other players or draw useless attention to one's self. <br /><br /><span style="color: #ce9707;">4.2 Event Disruption (Minor Offense)</span><br /> Game Masters run different game events daily. Players who disrupt these events (continuously messaging a GM, being in a zone they have been asked not to be in, harassing participants, etc.) will be subject to penalties.<br /><br /><span style="color: #ce9707;">4.3 False Reporting (Minor Offense)</span><br /> Reporting false information such as presenting yourself as a hack victim to profit from this action is illegal. This also applies to giving false information about others players to get them into trouble or continuously accusing other players of non-factual information.<br /><br /><span style="color: #ce9707;">4.4 Player Harassment / Swearing (Minor to Major  Offense)</span><br /> Swearing is using curse words or profane words in any language that can be seen by any other player. Although we have implemented a program to filter the use of swear words during the game some players may find ways to get around this with the use of other characters or symbols. Remember not everybody is the same. Each has their own creed, religion, race and personal culture and what is okay with you and your peers may not be okay for them.<br /><br /><span style="color: #ce9707;">4.5 Vulgarity (Minor to Major Offense)</span><br />Vulgarity is the use of lewd and indecent words in character names, guild names and messages. This game has players of all ages and such words whether sexually implicit or not may be considered inappropriate for them. It is also considered vulgar to use letters, numbers and symbols to create graphics that are sexually implicit.  Insulting other players occurs when a player or group of players uses vulgarity or swear words against another player or party for any particular reason. It is the use of insults in order to degrade another or hurt their feelings. Some comments do not necessarily have to contain swear words to be insulting to a person. Player remarks can be hateful, degrading, racist, and very discriminatory. <br /><br /><span style="color: #ce9707;">4.6 Threatening (Major Offense)</span><br />We do not tolerate threatening of other players with challenges that result in violent outcomes. These include fights, shooting, stabbing, killing and threats to seek and beat up other players out of the game. Please keep it in-game.<br /><br /><span style="color: #ce9707;">4.7 Harassing Game Masters (Major Offense)</span></p>
Harassment of Game Masters or other Garena employees such as Blackshot Agents and Staff is a punishable offense. Harassment includes booting Garena employees out of the game room or spamming at them. Game Masters may issue a verbal or written warning before issuing penalties to the offending party.
<p><br /><span style="color: #ce9707;">4.8 Garena / Blackshot Employee Impersonation (Major Offense)</span><br /> This occurs  when a player pretends to be a Game Master or employee of Garena (including Blackshot Agents/Specialists) in order to  extract personal information, account information such as username and  password, in-game currency, or game items from another player. This is a form  of scamming and will not be tolerated by game management. <br /><br /><span style="color: #ce9707;">4.9 Illegal Trading (Major Offense)</span><br /> Illegal Trading is when another player sells or buys Garena accounts/clans or any items in exchange for real money. This also includes the trading of items that represent any money value such as prepaid cards. Trading in-game items for real money, game load, prepaid load, or any other property outside of the game is strictly prohibited. Illegal trading will not be honoured as a valid excuse reason for acquiring items, if the items were reported missing, the account will be held liable for account hacking, if the item is illegal, the account will be blocked accordingly.<br /><br /><span style="color: #ce9707;">4.10 Account Hacking (Major Offense)</span><br /> Account hacking is accessing another characters account in order to use/sell items/GS, delete the character, or obtain personal information about the character or about the player himself.<br /><br /> <span style="color: #ce9707;">4.11.A Game Hacking / Use of Illegal Third Party Programs (Major Offense)</span><br /> Third party programs are programs that are used in order to change or modify the game client. This includes wall hacks, tapping hacks, speed hacks, duplicating programs, key loggers (any form) and cheat engines that may edit game modifiers or character stats. It is illegal to advertise or distribute any third party programs inside and outside the game, as well as advertising fake websites.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce9707;">4.11.B Assisting Hack User / Illegal Third Party Program User (Minor - Major Offense)</span><br /> Accomplice/assistance of hack/illegal third party program users  are subjected for punishment in benefiting from the main hack user. It is the user's responsibility to inform the hack user to stop his illegal activity or choose to leave the game room to not be considered as accomplice.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce9707;">4.12.A Game Fixing / Flagging (Major Offense)</span><br /> Flagging/Farming in Blackshot terms, is not allowed and strongly discouraged amongst players. Game Fixing includes killing players repeatedly who aren't moving or are Away From Keyboard (AFK), as well as taking turns to flag without any actual combat on-going. <br /> <br /> <span style="color: #ce9707;">4.12.B Game Fixing / Flagging - Clan Match (Major Offense)</span><br /> Flagging/Farming in Blackshot terms, is not allowed and strongly  discouraged amongst clans. Game Fixing includes killing players  repeatedly who aren't moving or are Away From Keyboard (AFK), as well as  taking turns to flag without any actual combat on-going. Fixing game wins in terms of exchanging win or lose with another clan.<br /><br /> <span style="color: #ce9707;">4.13 Bug Exploitation / Glitching (Major Offense)</span><br /> Bugs in the game should always be reported to Blackshot Game Masters / Agents as soon as they discovered the bug. The management shall reserve the rights to penalize those players who abuse the bugs for personal gain. A very good example is crate, box or ladder glitching.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ce9707;">4.14 Scamming (Major Offense)</span><br /> Scamming in Blackshot is not allowed. Scamming includes providing players with 3rd party links with promises of GS, GS weapons and ETC or by obtaining player’s Garena Username and password for your own personal benefits though underhand methods.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffe2a6; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; text-transform: uppercase; line-height: 1.22;">5. Penalties</span><br /> <span style="color: #ce9707;">For Minor Offense to Major Offense</span></p>
<p>14-day Ban<br /> 30-day Ban<br /> Permanent Ban</p>
<span style="color: #ce9707;"><em>*Depending on the severity of the offense.</em></span><br /> <br /><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>For Game Fixing / Flagging</strong> </span><br /><em><strong>First Offense: </strong></em> <br />De-rank to 60% of current EXP <br />De-rank to 60% of current Weapon Mastery<br /> Reset Character (Kill/Death) Ratio<br /> Additional 1,000 on Deaths<br /><br /> <em><strong>Excessive Game Fixing/Farming:</strong></em><br /> Blackshot Account Permanent Ban (no appeal)<br /><br /> <span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>For Game Fixing / Flagging (Clan)</strong></span><br /> Reset win/lose/draw record to 0.<br /> <em><strong>Excessive Game Fixing/Farming:</strong></em><br /> Clan disbandment/deletion<br /> <br /><span style="color: #99cc00; font-size: 8pt;">*Abuse policy may change and update without prior notice.</span><br /> <span style="color: #ce9707;"><em><br /></em></span>
